#+TITLE: Help Me Share

* Description
  /Help Me Share/ is a small javascript utility which adds /Share/ buttons for
  various services, i.e. /twitter/ and /facebook/.

  It embedded the native twitter and facebook buttons and does not use any
  intermediary. As a result the sharing statistics are not given away to any
  third-party except to the service that user clicked.

** Features
   - Each supported sharing service has a /plugin/.
     + Currently there are only twitter and facebook plugins.
   - You can decide which plugins to use.
   - You can specify various configuration options for the plugins.

* Rationale
  There is a lot of sharing services one may what to use. It is troublesome
  to include all the buttons you may want manually. Hence, the project. You
  need include one =<div>=, the javascript and call a function which will
  create the buttons you want.

  It is intended as a facility to simplify embedding and configuring third
  party sharing services on your website.
  
  It is worth noting that there are some alternatives, most notably [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShareThis][Share
  This]]. One feature that differentiate =Help Me Share= is that it uses the
  sharing services directly. For instance, if your user clicks on the =Like=
  button the request will go directly to facebook. There are no other
  intermediaries to gather your visitors data.
