#+TITLE: Help Me Share
#+STARTUP: showeverything

* Description
  /Help Me Share/ is a small javascript utility which adds /Share/ buttons for
  various services, i.e. /twitter/ and /facebook/.

  It embedded the native twitter and facebook buttons and does not use any
  intermediary. As a result the sharing statistics are not given away to any
  third-party except to the service that user clicked.

** Features
   - Each supported sharing service has a /plugin/.
     + Currently there are only twitter and facebook plugins.
   - You can decide which plugins to use.
   - You can specify various configuration options for the plugins.

* Rationale
  There is a lot of sharing services one may what to use. It is troublesome
  to include all the buttons you may want manually. Hence, the project. You
  need include one =<div>=, the javascript and call a function which will
  create the buttons you want.

  It is intended as a facility to simplify embedding and configuring third
  party sharing services on your website.
  
  It is worth noting that there are some alternatives, most notably
  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShareThis][Share This]].
  One feature that differentiate =Help Me Share= is that it uses the
  sharing services directly. For instance, if your user clicks on the =Like=
  button the request will go directly to facebook. There are no other
  intermediaries to gather your visitors data.

  Please see an [[#example][example]] or go straight to the [[#quickstart][quickstart]].

* Example

  An example of a custom style, live demo at http://igor.kupczynski.info/.

* Quickstart
  1. Grab the mimified java script at:     
     [[https://raw.github.com/puszczyk/help-me-share/master/resources/stable/hms.min.js]]

  2. Put the following tag in the place where you want the buttons to show:
     #+BEGIN_SRC html
     <div id="hms-container"></div>     
     #+END_SRC
  
  3. Include the script near the end of your page, e.g. just before the
     closing =</body>= tag and configure the options.

     #+BEGIN_SRC html
     <script src="js/hms.js"></script>
     <script>
     help_me_share.core.init(
            'hms-container',
            {'twitter-via': 'test-user'}
     );
     </script>
     #+END_SRC

     The function =help_me_share.code.init= does the job of creating
     buttons. It needs two arguments:

     * Id of the container,
     * Map of configuration options.

     For quickstart it is sufficient to give your twitter account name.

  4. Style the container.

     You need either to provide your own style or use one of the
     defaults. The defaults can be downloaded from the following locations:
     
     * [[https://raw.github.com/puszczyk/help-me-share/master/resources/public/css/hms.css]]
     * https://raw.github.com/puszczyk/help-me-share/master/resources/public/css/hms-fixed.css
       
     And then included on the page within the meta tag:

     #+BEGIN_SRC html
     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/hms.css"/>
     #+END_SRC

* Configuration

* Default Styles
** Example A
  #+CAPTION: Example 2. Default style - embedded on a page.
  #+NAME: fig:ex2
  [[./docs/img/ex2.png]]

  Default style - button are embedded on a fixed position in relation to the
  site content.

** Example B
  #+CAPTION: Example 3. Default style - floating on the left.
  #+NAME: fig:ex3
  [[./docs/img/ex3.png]]

  Alternative style - buttons are on the a fixed position in relation to
  the browser frame and appear to be floating over the site content.
