#+TITLE: Help Me Share
#+STARTUP: showeverything
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
* Description
  /Help Me Share/ is a small javascript utility which adds /Share/ buttons for
  various services, i.e. /twitter/ and /facebook/.

  It embedded the native twitter and facebook buttons and does not use any
  intermediary. As a result the sharing statistics are not given away to any
  third-party except to the service that user clicked.

** Features
   - Each supported sharing service has a /plugin/.
     + Currently there are only twitter and facebook plugins.
   - You can decide which plugins to use.
   - You can specify various configuration options for the plugins.

* Rationale
  There is a lot of sharing services one may what to use. It is troublesome
  to include all the buttons you may want manually. Hence, the project. You
  need include one =<div>=, the javascript and call a function which will
  create the buttons you want.

  It is intended as a facility to simplify embedding and configuring third
  party sharing services on your website.
  
  It is worth noting that there are some alternatives, most notably
  [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShareThis][Share This]].
  One feature that differentiate =Help Me Share= is that it uses the
  sharing services directly. For instance, if your user clicks on the =Like=
  button the request will go directly to facebook. There are no other
  intermediaries to gather your visitors data.

  Please see an [[#example][example]] or go straight to the [[#quickstart][quickstart]].

* Example
  #+CAPTION: Example 1. Custom style (taken from http://igor.kupczynski.info/).
  #+NAME: fig:ex1
  [[./docs/img/ex1.png]]

  An example of a custom style, live demo at http://igor.kupczynski.info/.

* Quickstart
** Grab the mimified code
   
   Download if from: 
   [[https://raw.github.com/puszczyk/help-me-share/master/resources/stable/hms.min.js]]

** Insert the container div

   Put the following tag in the place where you want the buttons to show.
   #+BEGIN_SRC html
   <div id="hms-container"></div>     
   #+END_SRC
  
** Invoke the script

   Include the script near the end of your page, e.g. just before the closing
   =</body>= tag and configure the options.
   #+BEGIN_SRC html
   <script src="js/hms.js"></script>
   <script>
   help_me_share.core.init(
          'hms-container',
          {'twitter-via': 'test-user'}
   );
   </script>
   #+END_SRC

   The function =help_me_share.code.init= does the job of creating buttons. It
   needs two arguments:

   + Id of the container,
   + Map of configuration options. For quickstart it is sufficient to give
     your twitter account name.

** Style the container

   You need either to provide your own style or use one of the defaults. The
   defaults can be downloaded from the following locations:
     
   * [[https://raw.github.com/puszczyk/help-me-share/master/resources/public/css/hms.css]]
   * https://raw.github.com/puszczyk/help-me-share/master/resources/public/css/hms-fixed.css
       
   And then included on the page within the meta tag:

   #+BEGIN_SRC html
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/hms.css"/>
   #+END_SRC

** Enjoy!

* Development
  Feel free to hack or contribute. The code is written in [[https://github.com/emezeske/clojurescript][clojurescript]] and
  can be build via [[https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen][leiningen]]. Leiningen is the only perquisite, make sure to
  have it installed.

  Steps to build help-me-share from source.

  1. Clone the code
      : $ git clone https://github.com/puszczyk/help-me-share.git help-me-share

  2. Build it
     #+BEGIN_SRC 
     $ cd help-me-share
     $ lein cljsbuild clean
     $ $ lein cljsbuild once
     #+END_SRC
     
  As a result you will have to files: =resources/public/js/hms.js= and
  =resources/public/js/hms.min.js=. The former is readable javascript for
  development and debugging purposes and the latter is mimified,
  [[https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/][google closure]] compiled and optimized version for a production use.

  You can easily test the code by putting the =resources/public= directory
  under a DOCUMENT ROOT of a web server or even use a simple python web
  server.
   : resources/public$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888

  Assuming that you used the python webserver, just go to
  [[http://localhost:8888/index-dev.html]] to visit the development
  version of the code. Please note that there are no stylesheets applied. To
  see the default styles in action on the production version go to
  [[http://localhost:8888/index.html]] and [[http://localhost:8888/index-fixed.html]].

  Enjoy!
